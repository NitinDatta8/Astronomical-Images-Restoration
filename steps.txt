STEPS: 
1. We will create an environment to replicate the desired effects.
2. Place the file "tf.yml" in a directory.
3. In anaconda prompt go to the directory and run this command "conda env create -v -f tf.yml"
4. After the environment is created run the command "conda activate tf"
5. Run this command "pip install opencv-python" after step 4
6. now navigate inside TF_pix2pix and run preprocessing to generate the required input for the model
7. run pix2pix.py for training the model/
