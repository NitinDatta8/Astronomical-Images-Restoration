# Astronomical-Images-Restoration
This project is about generating nearly original images using convoluted images by using Pix-2-Pix GAN 
As the dataset is private I cannot share the images here. 

# Steps to run the project

1. We will create an environment to replicate the desired effects.
2. Place the file "tf.yml" in a directory.
3. In anaconda prompt go to the directory and run the command `conda env create -v -f tf.yml`
4. After the environment is created run the command `conda activate tf`
5. Run the command `pip install opencv-python` after step 4
6. Now navigate inside TF_pix2pix and run `preprocessing.py` with appropriate arguments to generate the necessary files required for training 
7. Run `pix2pix.py` with appropriate arguments for training the model
